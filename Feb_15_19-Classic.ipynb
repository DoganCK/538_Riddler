    "You’re playing a “Price Is Right” game called Cover Up, which has contestants try to guess all five digits of the price of a brand new car. You have two numbers to choose from for the first digit, three numbers to choose from for the second digit, and so on, ending with six options for the fifth and final digit. You’re not winning any $100,000 cars in this game.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you lock in a guess at the entire price of the car. If you get at least one digit correct on the first guess, the correct digit(s) are highlighted and you get to replace incorrect digits on a second guess. This continues on subsequent guesses until the price is guessed correctly. But if none of the new numbers you swapped in are correct, you lose. A contestant could conceivably win the car on the first guess or with five guesses, getting one additional correct digit highlighted on each guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "First question: If you’re guessing entirely by chance, what’s the likelihood of winning the car?\n",
    "\n",
    "Second question: Suppose you know a little bit about cars. Specifically, you are 100 percent certain about the digit in the ten-thousands place, but have to guess the remaining four digits by chance. What’s the best strategy, and what’s the likelihood of winning the car now?"

    "There are some cases where holding onto the first digit might be helpful. For instance if we guess all the fifth digit correctly in the first round then there is an 80% chance we will fail in the second round trying to guess the fifth one. If we held onto the first digit and only said it in the second round we'd get a free pass on the second round with 20% chance to guess correctly besides we would get to guess another time in the third round with 25% chance of winning.\n",
